This project is a frame to report a car crash.
Each step is listed out and boxes are laid out to create a
copy paste response to submit to your insurence.
Do note that this is a WIP and certain insurance reporting steps might be different!

Code works by accepting input via input fields on the left and outputs into
an email-able structure which can be changed via corrections.
The section on the right could be copy-pasted directly into any
email application for easy submission.
