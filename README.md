This project is a frame to report a car crash.
Each step is listed out and boxes are laid out to create a
copy paste response to submit to your insurence.
Do note that this is a WIP and certain insurance reporting steps might be different!

Users are first sent to the landing page where there will be different links to different pages
each page will have different selects. ie. Settings, Car Crash Frame, possible other frames (Not Yet Implemented)
Code works by accepting input via input fields on the left and outputs into
an email-able structure which can be changed via corrections.
The section on the right could be copy-pasted directly into any
email application for easy submission.
